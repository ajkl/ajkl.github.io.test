title: H2O World!
---

Hello World post followed with an H2O World one!

I was at the H2O World 2014 summit in the historic [Computer History Museum](http://www.computerhistory.org/).
It was a 2-days conference packed with great talks from BigData industry experts to Kaggle Hackers.

[Oxdata](http://0xdata.com/) is doing some neat stuff in the in-memory big data analytics space. This is what their page says -

<blockquote>
Why H2O?

H2O is for data scientists and application developers who need fast, in-memory scalable machine learning for smarter applications. H2O is an open source parallel processing engine for machine learning. Unlike traditional analytics tools, H2O provides a combination of extraordinary math, a high performance parallel architecture, and unrivaled ease of use.

Few interesting take aways for me were -

1. (Sparkling Water)[http://0xdata.com/blog/2014/06/h2o-killer-application-spark/]
	Sparkling Water gives you best of both the worlds, Spark and H2O. So you get the Spark RDD power and H2O's Deep Learning power in one place. More on it soon..
2. (H2O Flow)[http://h2o.ai/blog/2014/11/introducing-flow/]
	I love notebooks! Notebook is the new commandline.
	I feel notebooks are really useful for Reproducible Research. H2O Flow which was recently announced is a really elegant way to perform exploratory Machine Learning tasks and Modeling.

As an added benefit, I got to interact with a lot of smart people.

Got a chance to meet [Prof. Trevor Hastie](http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/) who I personally like to think as the Father of Data :) He was kind enough to take a picture with me and sign my copy of [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0387952845/trevorhastie-20)

Also got to meet the creator of [data.table](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table/wiki), Matt Dowle[https://twitter.com/mattdowle]. I have been using data.table a lot lately to refactor some slow code pieces in my R code. Data.table is like dataframes on steriods. But this is not a post to talk about data.tables. More on it in another post.

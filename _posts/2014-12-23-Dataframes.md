title: Dataframes
---

I have been playing a lot lately with [Julia](http://julialang.org/).
In the past I have used python and R a lot for my data analysis tasks. I always tend to have some cheatsheet in front of me for the basic dataframe operations in pandas and R. Its hard to make that context switch in the syntax from one language to another.
With Julia, my brain was just not ready to accept another set of syntax.
So I thought a quick reference comparing the basic dataframe manipulation syntax for all 3 languages would be nice.
Most of my data tasks start with some ETL tasks on dataframes. So this is more of a reference for my use in future but can be useful to others too who face the same situation.

I took this awesome tutorial by [Greg Reda](http://www.gregreda.com/) on ["Working with DataFrames"](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/working-with-pandas-dataframes/) and tried to port the example to all R and Julia.

All the code from this post can be found at this [github repo dataframes-compare](https://github.com/ajkl/dataframes-cheatsheet)

We start with the [MovieLens 100k dataset](http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). 
From the README you can see :

<code>
This data set consists of:
	* 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies. 
	* Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
	* Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)
</code>

## Data import
Lets start with loading the data into our dataframe. The methods to read the data from a flat file are pretty simple and straight forward in all 3, the only tricky part is when adding column names in Julia. But there are ways to get around.

######Julia

<code>
using DataFrames
u_col_names=[symbol("user_id"), symbol("age"), symbol("sex"), symbol("occupation"), symbol("zip_code")]
</code>
Aanother way to do the same without adding each entry as a symbol. Thanks to [Jubobs](http://stackoverflow.com/users/2541573/jubobs) from this [stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27629206/why-does-this-list-comprehension-return-an-arrayany-1-instead-of-an-arraysymb/27629609#27629609) for the suggestion.

<code>
col_names=["user_id", "age", "sex", "occupation", "zip_code"]
u_col_names=map(symbol, col_names)
users = DataFrames.readtable("data/ml-100k/u.user", separator='|', header=false, names=u_col_names)
</code>

######Python

```
import pandas as pd

u_col_names = ['user_id', 'age', 'sex', 'occuptation', 'zip_code']
users = pd.read_csv('data/ml-100k/u.user', sep = '|', names=u_col_names)

r_col_names = ['user_id', 'movie_id', 'rating', 'unix_timestamp']
ratings = pd.read_csv('data/ml-100k/u.data', sep='\t', names=r_col_names)

# let's only load the first five columns of the file with usecols
m_col_names = ['movie_id', 'title', 'release_date', 'video_release_date', 'imdb_url']
movies = pd.read_csv('data/ml-100k/u.item', sep='|', names=m_col_names, usecols=range(5))
```

######R

```
u_col_names <- c('user_id', 'age', 'sex', 'occupation', 'zip_code')
users <- read.csv('data/ml-100k/u.user', sep='|', col.names=u_col_names)

r_col_names = c('user_id', 'movie_id', 'rating', 'unix_timestamp')
ratings = read.csv('data/ml-100k/u.data', sep='\t', col.names=r_col_names)

# let's only load the first five columns for movies using "usecols" param
m_col_names = c('movie_id', 'title', 'release_date', 'video_release_date', 'imdb_url')
movies = read.table('data/ml-100k/u.item', sep='|', colClasses=c("integer", "character", "factor", "factor", "character", rep("NULL", 19)), quote="")
#http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5788117/only-read-limited-number-of-columns-in-r also quotes in strings cause importing errors so you need quote="" 
#cannot specify col.names in read.table as we are skipping 19 columns. R will complain with "more columns than column names"
colnames(movies) <- m_col_names
```

If you notice closely R and python accept string literals in single quotes ' but Julia treats is as a character literal. I personally feel thats how it should be if I think about how C/C++ treats string literals.

## Sanity check
Now that we have the data loaded in our dataframes, its usually good practice to see the classes/types of each column. We will also try to get the summary statistics for the columns of our dataframe.

######Julia
```
eltypes(users)

	5-element Array{Type{T<:Top},1}:

```

We can see that the ratio is around 1:2.5 between female and male users and most of them (if you exclude "other") are students. Minimum age is 7 and it goes till 73 as the max.

## Subsetting

Lets try to query our data now and filter it with some conditions. 

#### Head/Tail
We will warmup with some top/bottom values to get a feel of the data we have at hand.


######Julia
```
head(users)
	6x5 DataFrame
	| Row | user_id | age | sex | occupation   | zip_code |
	|-----|---------|-----|-----|--------------|----------|
	| 1   | 1       | 24  | "M" | "technician" | "85711"  |
	| 2   | 2       | 53  | "F" | "other"      | "94043"  |
	| 3   | 3       | 23  | "M" | "writer"     | "32067"  |
	| 4   | 4       | 24  | "M" | "technician" | "43537"  |
	| 5   | 5       | 33  | "F" | "other"      | "15213"  |
	| 6   | 6       | 42  | "M" | "executive"  | "98101"  |
```
```
tail(users)
	6x5 DataFrame
	| Row | user_id | age | sex | occupation      | zip_code |
	|-----|---------|-----|-----|-----------------|----------|
	| 1   | 938     | 38  | "F" | "technician"    | "55038"  |
	| 2   | 939     | 26  | "F" | "student"       | "33319"  |
	| 3   | 940     | 32  | "M" | "administrator" | "02215"  |
	| 4   | 941     | 20  | "M" | "student"       | "97229"  |
	| 5   | 942     | 48  | "F" | "librarian"     | "78209"  |
	| 6   | 943     | 22  | "M" | "student"       | "77841"  |
```
If you want to select a custom number of rows in head or tail you can pass it as a param
```
head(users, 3)
	3x5 DataFrame
	| Row | user_id | age | sex | occupation   | zip_code |
	|-----|---------|-----|-----|--------------|----------|
	| 1   | 1       | 24  | "M" | "technician" | "85711"  |
	| 2   | 2       | 53  | "F" | "other"      | "94043"  |
	| 3   | 3       | 23  | "M" | "writer"     | "32067"  |
```

I wont paste the output of these for python and R as they are similar to what Julia shows..

######Python
```
users.head()
users.tail()
users.head(3)
```

######R
```
head(movies)
tail(movies)
head(movies, n=3)
```

#### Row subset

Lets try to get all the rows from 50th row to the 55th row

######Julia
```
users[50:55,:]
	6x5 DataFrame
	| Row | user_id | age | sex | occupation   | zip_code |
	|-----|---------|-----|-----|--------------|----------|
	| 1   | 50      | 21  | "M" | "writer"     | "52245"  |
	| 2   | 51      | 28  | "M" | "educator"   | "16509"  |
	| 3   | 52      | 18  | "F" | "student"    | "55105"  |
	| 4   | 53      | 26  | "M" | "programmer" | "55414"  |
	| 5   | 54      | 22  | "M" | "executive"  | "66315"  |
	| 6   | 55      | 37  | "M" | "programmer" | "01331"  |
```
######Python
```
users[50:55]
```
######R
```
users[50:55,]
```

#### Column subset

You can select a single column by column name.

######Julia
```
head(users[:occupation])
	6-element DataArray{UTF8String,1}:
	 "technician"
	 "other"     
	 "writer"    
	 "technician"
	 "other"     
	 "executive" 
```
######Python
```
users['occupation'].head()
```
######R
```
head(users$occupation)
```

Multiple column selection works by passing a vector of column names

######Julia
```
head(users[:,[:occupation, :sex, :age]])
	6x3 DataFrame
	| Row | occupation   | sex | age |
	|-----|--------------|-----|-----|
	| 1   | "technician" | "M" | 24  |
	| 2   | "other"      | "F" | 53  |
	| 3   | "writer"     | "M" | 23  |
	| 4   | "technician" | "M" | 24  |
	| 5   | "other"      | "F" | 33  |
	| 6   | "executive"  | "M" | 42  |
```

######Python
```
users[['occupation', 'sex', 'age']].head()
```

######R
```
head(users[,c('occupation', 'sex', 'age')])
```

#### Query / Conditional subset

Subsetting a dataframe based on querying a column for a condition can be achieved like this -

######Julia
```
users[users[:occupation] .== "writer", :]
	45x5 DataFrame
	| Row | user_id | age | sex | occupation | zip_code |
	|-----|---------|-----|-----|------------|----------|
	| 1   | 3       | 23  | "M" | "writer"   | "32067"  |
	| 2   | 21      | 26  | "M" | "writer"   | "30068"  |
	| 3   | 22      | 25  | "M" | "writer"   | "40206"  |
	| 4   | 28      | 32  | "M" | "writer"   | "55369"  |
	| 5   | 50      | 21  | "M" | "writer"   | "52245"  |
	⋮
	| 43  | 853     | 49  | "M" | "writer"   | "40515"  |
	| 44  | 896     | 28  | "M" | "writer"   | "91505"  |
	| 45  | 911     | 37  | "F" | "writer"   | "53210"  |
```
######Python
```
users[users.occupation == 'writer']
```
There is another way in python, by using the query construct of the dataframe. 
```
users.query('occupation=="writer"')
```
######R
```
users[users$occupation == 'writer',]
```
Notice the subtle changes in all these examples. For example in the last query subsetting, for python you dont need to specify "select all columns" by adding a ' ," ' as you do in Julia or a ', ' as you do in R.

I will try to write a followup post on Join on Dataframes in these 3 languages.
